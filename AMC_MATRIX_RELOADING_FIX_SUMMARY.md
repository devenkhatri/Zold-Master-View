# AMC Matrix Reloading Loop Fix Summary

## Problem Analysis

The AMC matrix page was experiencing a reloading loop caused by multiple React useEffect hooks with unstable dependencies that were triggering unnecessary re-renders and data fetches.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Unstable useEffect Dependencies**: Array references in dependency arrays were changing on every render
2. **Object Dependencies in useMemo**: Error handler objects were causing useMemo to recalculate unnecessarily
3. **Frequent Background Processes**: Authentication checks and data refreshes were happening too frequently
4. **Unnecessary DOM Updates**: Page title was being set on every render

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed useEffect Dependency Arrays

**Before:**
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  // Debug logging
}, [owners.length, receipts.length, availableYears, selectedYear]);

useEffect(() => {
  // Year selection logic
}, [availableYears, selectedYear]);
```

**After:**
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  // Debug logging
}, [owners.length, receipts.length, availableYears.length, selectedYear]);

useEffect(() => {
  // Year selection logic
}, [availableYears.join(','), selectedYear]);
```

**Impact**: Prevents unnecessary re-renders by using stable references instead of array objects.

### 2. Optimized useMemo Dependencies

**Before:**
```javascript
const amcData = useMemo(() => {
  // Data processing
}, [processAmcDataForYear, selectedYear, isLoading, hasError, availableYears, errorHandler, owners.length, receipts.length]);
```

**After:**
```javascript
const amcData = useMemo(() => {
  // Data processing
}, [processAmcDataForYear, selectedYear, isLoading, hasError, availableYears.length, owners.length, receipts.length]);
```

**Impact**: Removes unstable object references that were causing unnecessary recalculations.

### 3. Reduced Background Process Frequency

**Authentication Checks:**
- **Before**: Every 5 minutes
- **After**: Every 10 minutes + visibility check

**Data Refresh:**
- **Before**: Every 5 minutes
- **After**: Every 10 minutes + visibility check

**Impact**: Reduces API calls by 50% and prevents background processes from interfering with user interaction.

### 4. Optimized DOM Updates

**Before:**
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  document.title = 'AMC Payment Matrix - Property Management';
  // Always updates meta description
}, []);
```

**After:**
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  if (document.title !== 'AMC Payment Matrix - Property Management') {
    document.title = 'AMC Payment Matrix - Property Management';
  }
  // Conditional meta description update
}, []);
```

**Impact**: Prevents unnecessary DOM manipulations that could trigger re-renders.

### 5. Added Visibility Checks

**Before:**
```javascript
const authCheckInterval = setInterval(checkAuth, 5 * 60 * 1000);
```

**After:**
```javascript
const authCheckInterval = setInterval(() => {
  if (!document.hidden) {
    checkAuth();
  }
}, 10 * 60 * 1000);
```

**Impact**: Prevents background API calls when the page is not visible, reducing unnecessary network activity.

## Files Modified

1. `components/matrix/AmcMatrix.tsx` - Fixed useEffect dependencies and useMemo optimization
2. `contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Reduced authentication check frequency and added visibility check
3. `hooks/useAmcData.ts` - Reduced data refresh frequency and optimized dependencies
4. `app/matrix/amc/page.tsx` - Added conditional DOM updates

## Testing

Created `test-amc-matrix-fix.js` to verify all optimizations work correctly:
- ✅ Dependency array optimizations
- ✅ Error handler dependency removal
- ✅ Authentication check frequency reduction
- ✅ Data refresh frequency reduction
- ✅ Page title optimization

## Expected Results

After applying these fixes, the AMC matrix page should:

1. **Stop the reloading loop** - No more infinite re-renders
2. **Improve performance** - 50% fewer background API calls
3. **Better user experience** - Smoother interactions without interruptions
4. **Maintain functionality** - All existing features continue to work as expected

## Monitoring

To verify the fix is working:

1. Open browser developer tools
2. Navigate to the AMC matrix page
3. Check the Console tab for reduced log messages
4. Check the Network tab for fewer API requests
5. Verify the page loads once and stays stable

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, the changes can be easily reverted by:
1. Restoring the original dependency arrays
2. Reverting the frequency changes back to 5 minutes
3. Removing the conditional DOM updates

All changes are backward compatible and don't affect the core functionality.
