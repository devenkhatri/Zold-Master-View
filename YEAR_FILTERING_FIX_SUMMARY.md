# Year Filtering Fix Summary

## Issue Description
Critical bug where AMC matrix was showing data from wrong years (e.g., 2024 data appearing in 2025 view).

## Root Cause Analysis
The year filtering logic was correct, but there were potential issues with:
1. Date parsing inconsistencies between ISO strings and simple date formats
2. Insufficient debugging and validation
3. Potential React memoization issues
4. Cache invalidation problems

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Date Parsing Logic (`hooks/useMatrixData.ts`)
- Improved date parsing to handle both ISO strings (`2024-04-14T00:00:00.000Z`) and simple date strings (`2024-03-10`)
- Added comprehensive error handling and validation for parsed years
- Enhanced debugging with detailed logging for year filtering decisions

### 2. Added Data Integrity Validation (`hooks/useMatrixData.ts`)
- Added final validation step to ensure all cell data is from the selected year
- Comprehensive logging of validation errors if cross-year contamination is detected
- Year distribution analysis for debugging

### 3. Enhanced Matrix Component (`components/matrix/AmcMatrix.tsx`)
- Added data integrity check useEffect to validate matrix data after processing
- Enhanced debugging with receipt year distribution logging
- Improved memoization dependencies to include `owners.length` and `receipts.length`
- Added cross-year data contamination detection with detailed error reporting

### 4. Cache Invalidation (`app/api/amc-data/route.ts`)
- Updated cache version from `v2-amc-only` to `v3-year-filter-fix` to force cache refresh
- Ensures old cached data doesn't interfere with the fix

## Technical Details

### Enhanced Year Filtering Logic
```javascript
// Handle both ISO strings and simple date strings
if (typeof receipt.paymentDate === 'string') {
  if (receipt.paymentDate.includes('T') || receipt.paymentDate.includes('Z')) {
    receiptDate = new Date(receipt.paymentDate);
  } else {
    receiptDate = new Date(receipt.paymentDate + 'T00:00:00.000Z');
  }
} else {
  receiptDate = new Date(receipt.paymentDate);
}
```

### Data Integrity Validation
- Post-processing validation ensures no cell contains data from wrong years
- Detailed error reporting with examples of contaminated cells
- Console logging for debugging and monitoring

### Improved Debugging
- Year distribution analysis in receipt data
- Detailed logging of filtering decisions
- Cross-year contamination detection and reporting

## Testing
- Created comprehensive test scripts to verify year filtering logic
- Tested with mixed year data (2022, 2023, 2024, 2025)
- Verified no cross-contamination between years
- Build tests pass successfully

## Expected Outcome
- AMC matrix now correctly shows only data for the selected year
- Enhanced debugging helps identify any future data integrity issues
- Improved error handling and validation prevents silent failures
- Cache invalidation ensures fresh data processing

## Monitoring
The enhanced logging will help monitor the fix in production:
- Look for "✅ Data integrity check passed" messages
- Watch for "❌ CROSS-YEAR DATA DETECTED" error messages
- Monitor year distribution logs for data consistency
